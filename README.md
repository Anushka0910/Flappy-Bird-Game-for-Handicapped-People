# Flappy-Bird-Game-for-Handicapped-People
This innovative version of the classic Flappy Bird game is designed to be controlled through head movements, making it accessible to players with disabilities and adding a unique twist to the traditional gameplay. Instead of using keyboard or mouse controls, players use real-time head gestures to navigate the bird through a series of pipes.
